        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> My name is Olin, and I live in Austin, Texas with my wife, son, cat, and dog. I have a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Washington, and I currently work as a Taxonomy Analyst for <a id="indeed" target="_blank" href="https://indeed.com">Indeed.com</a>. </p>
        
        <p> My primary interests are in formal logic and the foundations of mathematics and science, as well as knowledge architecture, data science, and artificial intelligence. I firmly believe that attention to the history and philosophy of science and mathematics can improve and strengthen our ability to grapple with the moral, conceptual, and material challenges of the coming decades, both within tech, and in the wider world. </p>
