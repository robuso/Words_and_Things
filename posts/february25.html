<h1 class="unnumbered" id="hello-world">Hello World!</h1>
<p>The name of this blog is ‘Words and Things’. This is a not unsubtle allusion to one of my intellectual heros, Willard Van Orman Quine, and one of his most well-known books, <em>Word and Object</em>.</p>
<p>Quine was an exemplar of a philosophical spirit which I admire, and is joined in this company by David Hume, Charles Sanders Pierce, Clarence Irving Lewis, William James, John Dewey, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rudolph Carnap, Nelson Goodman, Wilfred Sellars, Donald Davidson, and Richard Rorty, amongst others.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The essence of this spirit is a feeling that the human condition is at once wholly subsumed within the natural order of the world, but equally an active participant in delineating the content and structure of that natural order. If this sounds paradoxical to you, then you have identified the motivating core of their shared intellectual project.</p>
<p>These philosophers have all recognized the plain truth that language is a primary means of describing the world, but also the equally plain—but far less popular—truth that language is also a primary means of creating that world to be described. Again, as you read this, you may recoil at that phrasing, and feel prepared to dismiss this view out of hand. But I would implore you to hear them (and me) out. These were not foolish men, and a good many of them were forced to adopt this position, not by dogmatism or ideology, but rather in a remarkably sober pursuit of a naturalist world-view.</p>
<p>John Dewey perhaps psychologized the opposition to this project most clearly in his book <em>The Quest for Certainty</em>. As the title suggests, Dewey hypothesized that people are disposed to reject the pragmatist view of meaning and metaphysics because it, almost uniquely amongst the grand intellectual projects, makes no promise that certianty about any claim is attainable, <strong>not even in principle</strong>. And, Dewey continues, <em>certianty</em> is what we crave. It is that around which we structure our individual lives and our social structures. It is what we go to war to secure, and it is what we’ll die to defend. Pragmatism, as this view is (admittedly, somewhat misleadingly) called, asks us to give up certainty, and with it appeals to authorities who promise access to such certainty. And while historically the tradition has been primarily focused on pragmatism within the realms of metaphysics, epistemology, and semantics, the lessons of pragmatism ramify throughout the entirety of the human experience—in ethics, politics, education, and the religious impulse.</p>
<p>Why am I writing about pragmatism in this inagural article for my blog? First, because I consider myself a pragmatist, and if anything, the inagural post seems like as good a place as any to write one’s manifesto. But second, because I believe that the intellectual project of pragmatism has been forgotten, ignored, or simply undiscovered. I think their lessons are particularly apt now, when communication has (seemingly) zero cost, authority is (apparently) decentralized, and truth is (really) up for grabs. And at the same time, the heralding of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as the solution to what ails us hides a deeply mistaken conceptual core that cannot withstand scrutiny. So these will, in large part, be the topics of discussion for this blog—discourse, truth, and reality, along with excursions into our ML future, and what it can and cannot do.</p>
<p>I hope to see you around.</p>

There are undoubtedly women who have contributed equally to the intellectual project I describe, but due to my own ignorance and blinkered education, I cannot name them. In the future I hope to add to this list as my horizons broaden, and I intend to amend and expand this list.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
